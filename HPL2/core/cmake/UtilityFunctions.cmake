### build up utility functions

## Find a prebuiltlib
## Must set a cache/global var of PREBUILT_PLATFORM_ROOT so this function knows where to find the libraries.
## the epected structure is simply to have the libs/frameworks in the directory pointed to by that variable.
## for multi-arch linux putting libs in two subdirectories of lib and lib64 will allow cmake to find the right ones
